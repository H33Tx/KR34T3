    "Hallihallo, saintly2k speaking. Rather writing but haha.
    <br><br>
    First off: Thanks for using this Software, that really means something to me (and the others working on this)!
    <br><br>
    After that, my intention when starting this project at 31st December 2021 (yes, new yera lol) was simple: A Release-System like XRS (Xylithiol-Release-System). But even Better :D
    <br><br>
    But I mean, with my current PHP skills... well. The code is all messy but that doesn't matter since it works fine, hehe. Security should also be no problem, except I can't do shit about bruteforce attacks for now.
    <br><br>
    So, if anyone wanna help out, make sure to <a href="https://wiki.henai.eu/index.php/Software/KR34T3" target="_blank">read the Wiki</a> about where we need help and comment on the latest Cracked.to Thread of the Release-System. Alternatively, you can also try eMailing me via <a href="mailto:guro@henai.eu">guro@henai.eu</a>.
    <br><br>
    Documentation can be found on <a href="https://wiki.henai.eu/index.php/Software/KR34T3" target="_blank">wiki.HENAI.eu!</a>
    <br><br>
    Have fun releasing whatever you want, peace out.
    <br><br>
    P.S: Please do not publish the code elsewhere, like on GitHub or so, thx!"<br><i>~ saintly2k</i>
