    "Hallihallo, saintly speaking. Rather writing but haha.
    <br><br>
    First off: Thanks for using this Software, that really means something to me!
    <br><br>
    After that, my intention when starting this project at 31st December 2021 (yes, new yera lol) was simple: A Release-System like XRS (Xylithiol-Release-System). But even Better :D
    <br><br>
    But I mean, with my current PHP skills... well. The code is all messy but that doesn't matter since it works fine, hehe. Security should also be no problem, except I can't do shit about bruteforce attacks for now.
    <br><br>
    So if anyone wanna help out, please feel free to create a Fork on <a href="https://github.com/H33Tx/KR34T3" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:ninefreaks@yandex.com" target="_blank">ninefreaks@yandex.com</a>
    <br><br>
    Have fun releasing whatever you want, peace out."<br><i>~ saintly2k</i>
